# zod-introduction
A small repository to show off some small zod example code.
You can find [more on zod here](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)

## requirements
You only need [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) and a code editor of your choice (vscode recommended for a quick look)

## how to use
To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run the examples:
```bash
bun run start:simple
bun run start:medium
bun run start:utility
```
which you can also find in [the package.json file](./package.json) in the `scripts` section
